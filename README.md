Project Description
This website was developed using React (Vite) and styled with Tailwind CSS. It features a clean and responsive UI enhanced by CSS motion animations.

Key functionalities include:

- A sticky navigation bar with smooth scrolling for seamless user experience.

- A sample shopping cart system, with state persisted via Local Storage.

- An infinite scroll mechanism that dynamically fetches more data from an API, along with pagination for structured data presentation.

- A validated contact form, ensuring proper input for name (minimum 3 characters), valid email format, and 10-digit phone number. Form submissions are handled via EmailJS.

- A Dark Mode toggle for theme switching based on user preference.
